# 🛰️ Sentinel OS

> A lightweight real-time operating system for autonomous AI agents on edge devices.

## 🧠 What is Sentinel OS?

**Sentinel OS** is a minimalist, real-time operating system built from scratch in C with Python integration. It is designed to control autonomous agents running on edge hardware like drones, embedded systems, and off-grid robotics — where low latency, resilience, and independence from the cloud are critical.

Rather than relying on bloated distributions like Linux, Sentinel OS is engineered to run efficiently on limited hardware while exposing hooks for high-level AI decision-making logic. It is both the *brain* and *nervous system* for machines that need to operate in unpredictable environments.

## 🎯 MVP Goals by October 2025

The goal is to build a fully functional MVP of Sentinel OS that includes:

### 🔧 Core OS Features (in C):
- A **minimal shell interface** to interact with the system
- A **preemptive or cooperative task scheduler** to manage concurrent processes
- A **custom memory allocator** (`malloc` / `free`)
- Basic **I/O management** (e.g., read from mock sensors or virtual input)
- Logging and task reporting via a simple **virtual file system**

### 🧠 AI Agent Layer (in Python):
- A Python agent that interfaces with the OS via `ctypes` or `CFFI`
- Agent responds to system logs, sensor inputs, or performance metrics
- Example AI logic: auto-restarting a crashed task, memory optimization suggestions, simple decision tree logic

### 🧩 C↔Python Integration:
- Expose low-level C system functions to high-level Python scripts
- Enable Python to execute commands, read logs, and trigger system actions

### 📊 (Optional) Monitoring Interface:
- Basic CLI dashboard or Flask web panel to visualize:
  - Task list and states
  - Memory usage
  - Agent decisions and system events

## 💥 Why It Matters

- **No Dependencies:** Entirely independent from Linux or external OS frameworks.
- **Performance-Focused:** Built with low-level control over memory, CPU, and scheduling.
- **Intelligence-Ready:** Runs AI decision logic locally for smart autonomy.
- **Use-Case:** Perfect for disaster response bots, off-grid rovers, remote monitoring systems, and future interplanetary devices.

## 🔭 Long-Term Vision

While the MVP focuses on a minimal system and one AI agent, the broader vision includes:

- Real-world hardware integration (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Jetson Nano)
- Agent collaboration and multi-process communication
- Integration with voice, vision, and spatial inputs
- Modular AI runtime extensions (LLMs, reinforcement learning, etc.)
